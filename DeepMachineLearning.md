# Deep Learning with TensorFlow

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a computer science research area that deals with methods to identify and implement systems and algorithms by which a computer can learn, based on examples given in the input.

The challenge of machine learning is to allow a computer to learn how to automatically recognize complex patterns and make decisions that are as smart as possible. The entire learning process requires a dataset as follows:

* **Training set**: this is the knowledge base used to train the machine learning algorithm. During this phase, the parameters of the machine learning model can be tuned according to the performance obtained.

* **Testing data**: this is used only for evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data.

Learning theory uses mathematical tools that are derived from **probability theory** and **information theory**. This allows you to assess the optimality of some methods over others.

There are basically three learning paradigms that will be briefly discusses:

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Learning with reinforcement

## Supervised learning

Supervised learning is an automatic learning task. It is based on a number of preclassified examples, in which the category of each of the inputs used as examples, should belong. In this case, the crucial issue is the problem of generalization. After the analysis of a sample of examples, the system should produce a model that should work well for all possible inputs.
